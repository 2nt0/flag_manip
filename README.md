<h3>Operation</h3>
Run main.py to print the average (rounded down to the nearest integer) RGB value of the PNG file included in the repository. Clone the repository and add your own image file (PNG format is supported; other image formats may not be successful) and edit the line of code containing the "flag_gb.png" string to your own image filename. The average RGB values of that image will now be printed instead of those of the included PNG file.
